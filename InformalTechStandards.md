# Informal Technical Standards

There are many standards in tech and engineering that
are not actually formal standards at all, but for one 
reason or another, everyone uses them.

This is an attempt to document them!


## Mechanical

### 1 1/8" panel mount holes

For some reason, this is rhe standard size for
many kinds of panel mount switches, USB chargers, etc.

It seems to largely come from automotive and marine. But,
if you need a hole in that general size range, might
as well make it 1 1/8.


## Electrical

### Connectors

#### 2.1mm

The 2.1mm barrel plug is extremely common, and more often
than not carries 12V DC.  However, it also carries other
voltages.

Counter intuitively, the female jack is sometimes used to
supply power, with short circuit protection.

The jack is very occasionally used for other things like
switches as well.   Although i5 is common in consumer gear,
it puts a surprising amount of trust in the user not to connect
incompatible things, and somehow it seems to work.
