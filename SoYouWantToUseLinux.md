# So you want to use Linux?

Here's what you should know!

## The Terminal

This is the one that scares new users the most, but the good news is, you can just ignore it.

The console is useful for many things.  The main thing is that a sequence of actions
can be written and shared with others,and another great feature is that you can log in
remotely over SSH.

Many claim that it is the best way to do almost anything, but I disagree.

The console is powerful, but it doesn't not watch your back.  Files deleted with rm are
truly deleted, not moved to trash.  Flashing a disk image to an SD card can overwrite your hard disk,
should you type the path of your main disk, not the external.

You will probably want to learn the terminal eventually, but it's
not any more necessary than it is on windows.

However, if you look around, you'll find many people doing things on the command line.
You may get the impression that there is no other way to do those things, but there usually is.


## Distros 

There is not one single "Linux OS".  
People have made thousands of variants, called Distros.

The act of switching between them rapidly is known as distro hopping.

Although there are thousands, the vast majority are not worth your time
In fact, you probably already know most of the ones that are.  Being free, anyone
Can make one, but very few people can make one well, as that takes an incredible amount of effort.


The biggest ones are mostly all variants of Ubuntu, itself a variant of Debian. If you're wondering what distro
to use and just want the easy one word answer, it's probably Kubuntu or Mint.

Do *not* trust DistroWatch.  They do not track what people are using, they track search
traffic.  You do not want the distros that people read about a lot!  The reliable ones being
used at home and in industry get a moderate and steady flow of traffic, people are too busy using
them to discuss details online.

Top DistroWatch distros are very likely to be the shiny new toy for distro hoppers, rather than
a solid and reliable platform.

### Arch 

This seems to be the most popular distro among enthusiasts. It
has no installer, you install yourself with a sequence of commands.  This is perfectly
fine, according to the fans.

It is not an easy distro.  It is advised that you read the forums before
updating any software, to be sure you don't break something.

It is loved for how much you learn while using it, and for it's up-to-data packages, but
that's not always a good thing.

You definitely *cannot* get by on this one without using the command line, although you probably can on
Manjaro.

#### Manjaro

This is built on Arch,but with a lot of things preconfigured. It
is easy enough for just about anyone, they say, but it still has some remnants
oof it's Arch heritage.


### Ubuntu Family (Ubuntu, Mint, Pop, Kubuntu)

This is what I would very strongly suggest.  Kubuntu has the
most full featured UI thanks to KDE Plasma, but you can install that later on others.


They are extremely popular, and designed for stability.

One notable thing is that they are fixed release.  Like windows,
there are versions that come out periodically.  With Arch, there is one
Arch that gets constant upgrades, so there is no true stable platfom.

The downside is that you will need to upgrade between fixed point. This is extremely easy if
you stick with LTS(Long Term Service) releases. Those are the ones generally suggested for most users.


There is of course, a chance that something breaks when upgrading, but
Arch can also break when upgrading packages.
