Inspired by a subreddit.

## Base systems

### Base 10
Base 10 is when each digit has 10x the value of the last. `111`= one hundred, one ten, and one one.

### Base 2(Binary)
Base 2 aka binary is the same thing with 2s. `1111`= one 8, one 4, one 2, and one 1

Since they look the same, in programming we mark binary literals with 0b, as in: `0b11` = 3 = 2+1

### Base 16(Hexadecimal)

Hex is the same, but with 16 values, 0 through 15 and, we use ABCDEF for the extra numbers. We mark hex with 0x(I don't know why). `0xFF` = 15*16 + 15*1 = 255 = the max number you can fit in a byte.

Now because four bits has 16 possible combinations(2 to the 4), we can use one hex digit(having 16 possible vals) to represent four bits.
This means we can use two hex digits for 8 bits, which is a byte, which makes hexadecimal very useful for binary data.

### Base 64
This is normally represented as ASCII text, and in the usual applicaion, is a little more complicated because
64 combinations only represents 6 bits, and bytes work with 8, meaning we must stufff three bytes into 4 characters, 
and in some cases special padding rules apply to the decoders.

Nonetheless, it is the same as the other base systems.

### Non-integer bases
These exist, but I am not going to pretend to understand them :P
